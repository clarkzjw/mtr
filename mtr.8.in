.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

HOSTNAME ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
combines the functionality of the
.Sy traceroute
and
.Sy ping
programs in a single network diagnostic tool.
.Pp
As
.Nm
starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
.Nm
runs on and
.Sy HOSTNAME
by sending packets with purposely low TTLs.  It continues to send packets with low TTL, noting the response time of the intervening routers.  This allows
.Nm
to print the response percentage and response times of the internet route to
.Sy HOSTNAME.
A sudden increase in packet loss or response time is often an indication of a bad (or simply overloaded) link.
.Pp
The results are usually reported as round-trip-response times in miliseconds and the percentage of packetloss.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a, Fl -address Ar IP.ADD.RE.SS
Use this option to bind outgoing packets' socket to specific interface, so that any packet will be sent through this interface.
.Sy Note
that this option doesn't apply to DNS requests (which could be and could not be what you want).
.ie "b"\*[on b]" \{\
.It Fl b, Fl -show-ips
Use this option to tell
.Nm
to display both the host names and numeric IP numbers.  In split mode this adds an extra field to the output.  In report mode, there is usually too little space to add the IPs, and they will be truncated.  Use the wide report mode
.Fl w
to see the IPs in report mode.
.\}
.It Fl B, Fl -bitpattern Ar NUM
Specifies bit pattern to use in payload.  Should be either within range 0-255, or -1 for random sampling.
.It Fl c, Fl -cycles Ar COUNT
Use this option to set the number of pings sent to determine both the machines on the network and the reliability of those machines.  Each cycle lasts one second.
.It Fl d, Fl -display Ar MODE
Use this option to select the initial display mode
.Bl -tag -offset Ds

.El
.\}
.It Fl i, Fl -interval Ar SECONDS
Use this option to specify the positive number of seconds between ICMP ECHO requests.  The default value for this parameter is one second.  The root user may choose values between zero and one.
.It Fl m, Fl -max-ttl Ar NUM
Specifies the maximum number of hops (max time-to-live value) traceroute will probe.  Default is 30.
.ie "n"\*[on n]" \{\
.It Fl n, Fl -no-dns

.Nm
to display numeric IP numbers and not try to resolve the host names
.\}
.ie "o"\*[oo]" \{\
.It Fl o, Fl -output Ar \*[oor] \*[oot] \*[ooc] \*[ooj] \*[oox]
Use one of these suboptions to get
.ie "r"\*[oor]" \{RAW\}
.ie "t"\*[oot]" \{TXT\}
.ie "c"\*[ooc]" \{CSV\}
.ie "j"\*[ooj]" \{JSON\}
.ie "x"\*[oox]" \{XML\}

.It Fl Q, Fl -tos Ar NUM
Specifies value for type of service (ToS) field in IP header.  Should be within range 0-255.

This option puts
.Nm
into report mode.  When in this mode,
.Nm
will run for the number of cycles specified by the
.Fl c
option, and then print statistics and exit.
.sp
This mode is useful for generating statistics about network quality.
.sp
Note that each running instance of
.Nm
generates a significant amount of network traffic.  Using
.Nm
to measure the quality of your network may result in decreased network performance.
.It Fl s, Fl -psize Ar BYTES
This option sets the packet size used for probing.  It is in bytes inclusive IP and ICMP headers.

into wide report mode.  When in this mode,
.Nm
will not cut hostnames in the report.

.\}
.It Fl Z, Fl -timeout Ar SECONDS
The number of seconds to keep the TCP socket open before giving up on the connection.  This will only affect the final hop.  Using large values for this, especially combined with a short interval, will use up a lot of file descriptors.

Use IPv4 only
.It Fl 6
Use IPv6 only
.\}

.Sh BUGS
Some modern routers give a lower priority to ICMP ECHO packets than to other network traffic.  Consequently, the reliability of these routers reported by
.Nm
will be significantly lower than the actual reliability of these routers.
